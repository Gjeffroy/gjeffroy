### Hi there, I am Guillaume 👋
<em>Data-enthusiast with Python and R</em>

I bring expertise in developing AI tools and visualization solutions.

My key skills include data automation, where I streamline the processing of structured data such as tables and dictionaries, and unstructured data like text, images, and audio. 
I also specialize in AI tool development, creating generative AI tools including RAG, chatbots, and fine-tuning models. 
Additionally, I build custom web applications, ranging from simple dashboards to advanced websites that are aesthetic, user-friendly, and responsive.

💬 Feel free to contact me to discuss your project.

# Portfolio

## 📊 Web application 
**Spatial Data with Shiny and Leaflet** [🔗](https://github.com/Gjeffroy/leaflet_viewer_shiny/tree/main) <br> 
A visually appealing Shiny app that presents two datasets: Seagull settlements in Lorient and Bigfoot sightings. The app displays the data on an interactive map with a timeline animation, allowing users to explore changes over time. Additionally, it includes data point clustering and density visualization to provide a thorough understanding of spatial distribution patterns.

**Production Grade Shiny App with Golem** [🔗](https://github.com/Gjeffroy/shiny-production-golem) <br>
I am exploring the Golem package for creating production-grade applications. In this project, I focus on crafting a data exploration tool, drawing plots and statistics using Shiny, Golem, and ggplot2, ensuring a robust and scalable solution.

## 🤖 Generative IA 
**LLM to summarise Scientifique articles** [🔗](https://github.com/Gjeffroy/Mistral7b_scientific_article) <br>
Here’s an example of running an LLM model on-premise: Unlock the power of Mistral 7B, LangChain, and Transformers (Hugging Face) on Colab to summarize scientific articles. I emphasized prompt engineering techniques to ensure reliable and consistent results.

**Data labeling with Generative AI** [🔗](https://github.com/Gjeffroy/labelling_data_with_llm/tree/main) <br>
Labeling data with Large Language Models (LLMs) using Python, LangChain, and pandas; An interesting process to get statistics out of text data and train lighter models (CNN, LSTM, etc) to perform similar classification tasks at a lower cost.

**Chatbot on personal data**  [🔗](https://github.com/Gjeffroy/chatbot_langchain_taipy/tree/main)<br>
<em>Development in progress... </em> 🚜👷🚧🏗️  A chatbot built in LangChain to question over 600 documents (pdf and HTML) related to the French secondary education curriculum.

## 🧠 Machine learning and Deep learning 
**A textbook exercise on predicting breast cancer** [🔗](https://github.com/Gjeffroy/breast_cancer_classification) <br>
Testing algorithm performances with the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. Compare classifiers, leveraging UMAP for insight. And ask ChatGPT to give its conclusion.   

**Automating Deep Learning with Keras Tuner: Architecture & Hyperparameter** [🔗](https://github.com/Gjeffroy/hyperparam_autotuning_keras/tree/main) <br>
Exploring Keras Tuner's efficacy on the MNIST dataset to optimize CNN architecture for maximizing validation accuracy   

## 🎒 Other adventures...

**Augmented reality with Three.js** [🔗](https://github.com/Gjeffroy/AR_with_threejs) <br>
Explore a simple integration of Three.js in a Python app powered by Flask, Gunicorn, and SQLAlchemy. Deployed seamlessly with Docker for enhanced flexibility and scalability.

# Course Material

**ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers** [🔗](https://github.com/Gjeffroy/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers) <br>
Go beyond the chat box. Use API access to leverage LLMs into your own applications, and learn to build a custom chatbot.  

**LangChain for LLM Application Development** [🔗](https://github.com/Gjeffroy/langchain-for-llm-application-development) <br>
The framework to take LLMs out of the box. Learn to use LangChain to call LLMs into new environments, and use memories, chains, and agents to take on new and complex tasks.  

**LangChain: Chat with Your Data** [🔗](https://github.com/Gjeffroy/langchain-chat-with-your-data ) <br>
Create a chatbot to interface with your private data and documents using LangChain.
