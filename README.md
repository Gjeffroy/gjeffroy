### Hi there, I am Guillaume ðŸ‘‹
<em>Data-enthusiast with Python and R</em>

I bring expertise in developing AI tools and visualization solutions.

My key skills include data automation, where I streamline the processing of structured data such as tables and dictionaries, and unstructured data like text, images, and audio. 
I also specialize in AI tool development, creating generative AI tools including RAG, chatbots, and fine-tuning models. 
Additionally, I build custom web applications, ranging from simple dashboards to advanced websites that are aesthetic, user-friendly, and responsive.

ðŸ’¬ Feel free to contact me to discuss a tailored plan for your project.
