### Hi there, I am Guillaume ðŸ‘‹
<em>Data-enthusiast with Python and R</em>

I bring expertise in developing AI tools and visualization solutions.

My key skills include data automation, where I streamline the processing of structured data such as tables and dictionaries, and unstructured data like text, images, and audio. 
I also specialize in AI tool development, creating generative AI tools including RAG, chatbots, and fine-tuning models. 
Additionally, I build custom web applications, ranging from simple dashboards to advanced websites that are aesthetic, user-friendly, and responsive.

ðŸ’¬ Feel free to contact me to discuss a tailored plan for your project.

# Portfolio

## ðŸ“Š Web application 
**Spatial Data with Shiny and Leaflet** [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Gjeffroy/leaflet_viewer_shiny/tree/main) <br> 
A visually appealing Shiny app that presents two datasets: Seagull settlements in Lorient and Bigfoot sightings. The app displays the data on an interactive map with a timeline animation, allowing users to explore changes over time. Additionally, it includes data point clustering and density visualization to provide a thorough understanding of spatial distribution patterns.

**Production Grade Shiny App with Golem** [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Gjeffroy/shiny-production-golem) <br>
I am exploring the Golem package for creating production-grade applications. In this project, I focus on crafting a data exploration tool, drawing plots and statistics using Shiny, Golem, and ggplot2, ensuring a robust and scalable solution.

## ðŸ¤– Generative IA 
**LLM to summarise Scientifique articles** [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Gjeffroy/Mistral7b_scientific_article) <br>
Example of running LLM model on-premise; Unlock the power of Mistral 7B, LangChain, and Transformer (Hugging Face) on Colab to summarize scientific articles  

**Data labeling with Generative AI** [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Gjeffroy/labelling_data_with_llm/tree/main) <br>
Labeling data with Large Language Models (LLMs) using Python, LangChain, and pandas; An interesting process to get statistics out of text data and train cost-effective models. 

**Chatbot on personal data**  <br>
Coming soon

## ðŸ§  Machine learning and Deep learning 
**A textbook exercise on predicting breast cancer** [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Gjeffroy/breast_cancer_classification) <br>
Explore breast cancer prediction with the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. Compare classifiers, leveraging UMAP for insight. Bonus: ChatGPT shares classifier conclusions. Dive in!   

**Automating Deep Learning with Keras Tuner: Architecture & Hyperparameter** [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Gjeffroy/hyperparam_autotuning_keras/tree/main) <br>
Exploring Keras Tuner's efficacy on the MNIST dataset to optimize CNN architecture for maximizing validation accuracy   

## ðŸŽ’ Other adventures...

**Augmented reality with Three.js** [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Gjeffroy/AR_with_threejs) <br>
Explore a simple integration of Three.js in a Python app powered by Flask, Gunicorn, and SQLAlchemy. Deployed seamlessly with Docker for enhanced flexibility and scalability.
