## Projects 
### LLM summarise Scientifique articles 
Unlock the power of Mistral 7B, LangChain, and Transformer on Colab to summarize scientific articles  [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Gjeffroy/Mistral7b_scientific_article)

### Augmented reality with Three.js 
Explore a simple integration of Three.js in a Python app powered by Flask, Gunicorn, and SQLAlchemy. Deployed seamlessly with Docker for enhanced flexibility and scalability.  [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Gjeffroy/AR_with_threejs)

### A textbook exercise on predicting breast cancer
Explore breast cancer prediction with the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. Compare classifiers, leveraging UMAP for insight. Bonus: ChatGPT shares classifier conclusions. Dive in!   [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Gjeffroy/breast_cancer_classification)

### Automating Deep Learning with Keras Tuner: Architecture & Hyperparameter
Exploring Keras Tuner's efficacy on the MNIST dataset to optimize CNN architecture for maximizing validation accuracy   [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Gjeffroy/hyperparam_autotuning_keras/tree/main)

### Spatial Data with Shiny and Leaflet
This Shiny app enables users to visualize Seagull settlements in Lorient and Bigfoot sightings over time using a slider animation. It also features data point clustering and density visualization for a comprehensive spatial distribution view.  [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Gjeffroy/leaflet_viewer_shiny/tree/main)

### Production Grade Shiny App with Golem
To streamline the journey from developing Shiny Apps to production, enter the realm of the Golem Package. In this project, I delve into crafting data-driven plots and statistics using Shiny, Golem, and Ggplot2."
